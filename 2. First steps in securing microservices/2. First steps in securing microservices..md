#### 2.1 Building the first microservices
(+) In this section, we build our first microservice, which accepts requests to create and manage orders, using `Spring Boot`.

(+)` Spring Boot` is a framework based on the Spring platform that allows you to convert functions written in the Java programming language to network-accessible functions, known as services or APIs, by decorating your code with a special set of annotations.

(+) Monolithic application is process-accessible meaning it is function calls in memory of a large app
(+) Microservice is network-accessible meaning it is API calls over HTTP.

###### OrderApplication.java
![[Pasted image 20250315204649.png]]

###### To run the application
(+) `mvn clean install`
(+) `mvn spring-boot:run`

###### To place an order
```
curl -v http://localhost:8080/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @- <<EOF | jq
{
  "items": [
    {
      "itemCode": "IT0001",
      "quantity": 3
    },
    {
      "itemCode": "IT0004",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "shippingAddress": "No 4, Castro Street, Mountain View, CA, USA"
}
EOF
```

(+) This will trigger the OrderProcessingService, specifically the `placeOrer` method for this service. 
(+) The `Order` object contains 3 elements, `orderID`, `items`, and `shippingAddress`. The `item` itself contains `itemCode` and `quantity`.
(+) So when we send the above request, it will send the `json` data via `POST` request to OrderProcessingService, where `json` data will be broken down to Order object above.
(+) After that we can view our order using the orderId.

###### To view an order
(+) `curl -v http://localhost:8080/orders/d7c25091-c435-4d0c-9650-5c57a1f18ee0 | jq`: This will trigger the `getOrder` method for the orderID and give us the `Order` object corresponding to the orderid in form of JSON data format.
