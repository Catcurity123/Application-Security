#### 2.1 Building the first microservices
(+) In this section, we build our first microservice, which accepts requests to create and manage orders, using `Spring Boot`.

(+)` Spring Boot` is a framework based on the Spring platform that allows you to convert functions written in the Java programming language to network-accessible functions, known as services or APIs, by decorating your code with a special set of annotations.

(+) Monolithic application is process-accessible meaning it is function calls in memory of a large app
(+) Microservice is network-accessible meaning it is API calls over HTTP.

###### OrderProcessingService.java

![[Pasted image 20250315204605.png]]

###### OrderApplication.java
![[Pasted image 20250315204649.png]]

###### To run the application
(+) `mvn clean install`
(+) `mvn spring-boot:run`

###### To place an order
```
curl -v http://localhost:8080/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @- <<EOF | jq
{
  "items": [
    {
      "itemCode": "IT0001",
      "quantity": 3
    },
    {
      "itemCode": "IT0004",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "shippingAddress": "No 4, Castro Street, Mountain View, CA, USA"
}
EOF
```

(+) This will trigger the OrderProcessingService, specifically the `placeOrer` method for this service. 
(+) The `Order` object contains 3 elements, `orderID`, `items`, and `shippingAddress`. The `item` itself contains `itemCode` and `quantity`.
(+) So when we send the above request, it will send the `json` data via `POST` request to OrderProcessingService, where `json` data will be broken down to Order object above.
(+) After that we can view our order using the orderId.

###### To view an order
(+) `curl -v http://localhost:8080/orders/8214c381-8627-469d-86e4-55191070cd10 | jq`: This will trigger the `getOrder` method for the orderID and give us the `Order` object corresponding to the orderid in form of JSON data format.

#### 2.2 Setting up an OAuth 2.0 server
(+) When combined with JWT, OAuth2.0 can be a highly scalable authentication and authorization mechanism, which is critical when it comes to securing microservices.

==> We agree that it’s not an authentication protocol at the client application end, but at the resource server end, which is the microservice

##### 2.2.1 The interactions with an Authorization Server (AS)
(+) In an OAuth 2.0 flow, the client application, the end user, and the resource server all interact directly with the authorization server, in different phases. Before requesting a token from an AS, the client applications have to register themselves with it.

![[Pasted image 20250405174026.png]]

(+) An authorization server issues tokens only for the client applications it knows. Some authorization servers support Dynamic Client Registration Protocol

![[Pasted image 20250405174236.png]]

(+) `The Order Processing microservice`, which plays the role of the resource server here, would `receive the token issued by the authorization server `from the client, usually as an HTTP header or as a query parameter when the client makes an HTTP request.

![[Pasted image 20250405174535.png]]



#### NOTE
(+) Having TLS to secure the communication (or in other words, the use of HTTPS) between all the entities in an OAuth 2.0 flow is extremely important. The token (access token) that the authorization server issues to access a microservice (or a resource) must be protected like a password.

(+) Upon receipt of the access token, the `Order Processing microservice` should `validate it against the authorization server before granting access to its resources`. An OAuth 2.0 authorization server usually supports the OAuth 2.0 token introspection profile

![[Pasted image 20250405174626.png]]

##### 2.2.2 Running the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server

```
curl -u orderprocessingapp:orderprocessingappsecret \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grant_type": "client_credentials", "scope": "read write"}' \
  http://localhost:8085/oauth/token | jq

```

![[Pasted image 20250405232907.png]]

#### 2.3 Securing a microservice with OAuth2.0
(+) In this section, you’ll see how to secure the microservice you developed. Up to now, you’ve accessed it without any security in place.

##### 2.3.1 Security based on OAuth2.0
(+) Once secured with OAuth 2.0, the `Order Processing microservice`now expects a valid security token (access token) from the calling client application. Then it will validate this access token with `AS`

![[Pasted image 20250405233031.png]]

(+) In the examples in this chapter so far, you’ve used the `client_credentials grant type` to obtain an access token from the authorization server. In this particular case, the token endpoint of the authorization server is protected via basic authentication with the client ID and the client secret of the application.

##### 2.3.2 Microservices with OAuth2.0

```
@EnableResourceServer 
@EnableWebSecurity 
@RestController 
@RequestMapping("/orders") 
public class OrderProcessingService extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter { }
```

(+) One addition to this class is the annotation `@Enable WebSecurity`. This annotation informs your Spring Boot runtime to apply security to the resources of this microservice.

```
@Bean 
public ResourceServerTokenServices tokenServices() { 
	RemoteTokenServices tokenServices = new RemoteTokenServices(); 
	tokenServices.setClientId("orderprocessingservice"); 
	tokenServices.setClientSecret("orderprocessingservicesecret"); 	tokenServices.setCheckTokenEndpointUrl("http://localhost:8085/oauth/check_token"); 
	return tokenServices; 
}
```

(+) If you go through the code of the `tokenServices` function, you’ll see that it uses a method named `setCheckTokenEndpointUrl` to set the value `http://local host:8085/oauth/check_token` as the `TokenEndpointURL` property in the `RemoteTokenServices` class. The `TokenEndpointURL` property is used by the Spring Boot runtime to figure out the URL on the OAuth 2.0 authorization server that it has to talk to, to validate any tokens it receives via HTTP requests.

(+) The endpoint that does the validation of the token itself is secure; it requires a valid Basic authentication header. This header should consist of a valid `client ID` and a `client secret`. In this case, one valid client ID and client secret pair is `orderprocessing` service and `orderprocessingservicesecret`, which is why those values are set in the `RemoteTokenServices` object.

##### 2.3.4 Invoking a secured microservice from a client application
(+) The client application at minimum requires a valid client ID and a client secret to obtain this token

```
curl -u orderprocessingapp:orderprocessingappsecret \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grant_type": "client_credentials", "scope": "write"}' \
  http://localhost:8085/oauth/token | jq
```

(+) If the request is successful, you should get an access token in response, as follows

```
  "access_token": "16bc2a38-e783-46df-986a-eab57259e003",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "scope": "read write"
```

(+) As discussed earlier, `8c017bb5-f6fd-4654-88c7-c26ccca54bdd` is the value of the access token you got, and it’s valid for 5 minutes (300 seconds). This access token needs to be provided to the HTTP request you’ll make to the Order Processing microservice.

```
curl -v http://localhost:8080/orders \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 88de098c-85eb-4abd-8101-b2ab28425bea" \
  --data-binary @- <<EOF | jq
{
  "items": [
    {
      "itemCode": "IT0001",
      "quantity": 3
    },
    {
      "itemCode": "IT0004",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "shippingAddress": "No 4, Castro Street, Mountain View, CA, USA"
}
EOF
```

(+) `-H` parameter is used to pass the access token as an HTTP header named `Authorization`. This time it works.

##### 2.3.5 Performing service-level authorization with OAuth 2.0 scopes
(+) You need a valid access token to access a microservice. `Authentication is the first level of defense applied to a microservice to protect it from spoofing`. The authentication step that occurs before granting access to the microservice ensures that the calling entity is a valid client (user, application, or both) in the system

==> Authentication, however, doesn’t mention anything about the level of privileges the client has in the system.

(+) A given microservice may have more than one operation. The Order Processing microservice, for example, has one operation for creating orders `(POST /orders)` and another operation for retrieving order details` (GET /orders/{id})`. Each operation in a microservice may `require a different level of privilege for access`.

(+) In the world of OAuth 2.0, privilege is mapped to a scope. A scope is way of abstracting a privilege. A privilege can be a user’s role, membership status, credibility, or something else. It can also be a combination of a few such attributes.

(+) The` place Order operation`, for example, requires a scope called `write`, and the `getOrder` operation requires a scope called `read`. 

```
curl -v http://localhost:8080/orders/ebd5ed77-9106-48f3-9c6d-b50b44c81c63 -H "Authorization: Bearer 16bc2a38-e783-46df-986a-eab57259e003" | jq
```

(+) Different application has different scopes when registering with the AS, in our case `OrderProcessingApp` has both `Read and Write`, but `OrderProcessingService` only has `Read`

![[Pasted image 20250406142729.png]]

(+) To test that if we were to ask `AS` to get an access token, from the `OderProcessService` by.

```
curl -u orderprocessingservice:orderprocessingservicesecret \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"grant_type": "client_credentials", "scope": "read write"}' \
  http://localhost:8085/oauth/token | jq
```

![[Pasted image 20250406143359.png]]

==> An error is return as this application can not obtain this scope.

##### 2.5.2 Protecting access to a microservice with OAuth 2.0 scopes

![[Pasted image 20250406143839.png]]

(+) As you can see, the code instructs the microservice runtime (Spring Boot) to check for the relevant scope for the particular HTTP method and request path. 

(+) This line of code checks for the scope write for any `POST` request made against the request path that matches the regular expression `/orders/`. Similarly, this line of code checks for the scope read for `GET` requests on path `/orders/{id}`

```
.antMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, 
	SECURED_PATTERN_WRITE).access(SECURED_WRITE_SCOPE)
.antMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, 
	SECURED_PATTERN_READ).access(SECURED_READ_SCOPE)
```

(+) Similar to when we try to read with a write token, it wouldn't work. In our case also, if we were to write using a read token.
