#### 1.1 How security works in a monolithic application
(+) A monolithic application has few entry points. An `entry point` for an application is analogous to a door in a building. Just as a door lets you into a building, an application entry point lets your request in.

(+) When you have more entry points, you have more places to worry about securing. The more entry points to an application, the broader the attack surface is. 

(+) In a typical Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (java EE) web application such as the one in the picture below, all request are scanned for security at the application level by a `servlet filter`. This security screening checks whether the `current request is associated with a valid web session` and, if not, challenges the requesting party to authenticate first.

![[Pasted image 20241116163548.png]]

(+) Further access-control checks may validate that the requesting party has the necessary permissions to do what they intend to do. `The servlet filter` (the interceptor) carries out such checks centrally to make sure that only legitimate requests are dispatched to the corresponding components. Internal components need not worry about the legitimacy of the requests; they can rightly assume that if a request lands there, all the security checks have already been done.

![[Pasted image 20241116163934.png]]

==> In most monolithic applications, security is enforced centrally, and individual components need not worry about carrying out additional checks unless there is a desperate requirement to do so.

#### 1.2 Challenges of securing microservices
##### 1.2.1 The broader the attack surface, the higher the risk of attack
(+) Under microservices architecture, internal components are designed as` separate, independent microservices`, and those `in-process calls among internal components become remote calls`. Also, each microservice now independently accepts requests or has its own entry points.

![[Pasted image 20241116164334.png]]

(+) Instead of a couple of entry points, as in a monolithic application, now you have a large number of entry points. As the number of entry points to the system increases, the attack surface broadens too. `As security of a system is no stronger than the strength of its weakest link`.

#### 1.2.2 Distributed security screening may result in poor performance
(+) Each microservice in a microservices deployment has to carry out independent security screening, comparing to monolithic's point of view this separate security screening seems redundant.

(+) While validating requests at each microservice, you may need to connect to a remote Security Token Servie (STS). These `security checks` and `remote connections` could contribute heavily to latency and degrading the performance of the system.

##### 1.2.3 Deployment complexities make bootstrapping trust among microservices a nightmare 
(+) Managing a large-scale microservices deployment with thousands of services would be extremely challenging if you didn’t know how to automate. 

(+) Service-to-service communication happens among multiple microservices. Each of these communication channels must be protected, but suppose that we will use certificates

(+) Now each microservice must be provisioned with a `certificate` (and the corresponding private key), which it will use to authenticate itself to another microservice during service-to-service interactions. 

(+) The recipient microservice must know how to validate the certificate associated with the calling microservice. Therefore, you need a way to bootstrap trust between microservices. Also, you need to be able to revoke certificates (in case the corresponding private key gets compromised) and rotate certificates (change the certificates periodically to minimize any risks in losing the keys unknowingly).

##### 1.2.4 Requests spanning multiple microservices are harder to trace
(+) `Observability` is a measure of what you can infer about the internal state of a system based on its external outputs. `Logs`, `metrics`, and `traces` are known as the three pillars of observability.

(+) A `log` can be any event you record that corresponds to a given service.

(+) `Aggregating a set of logs` can produce `metrics`. In a way, metrics reflect the state of the system. In terms of security, the average invalid access requests per hour is a metric.

(+) `Traces` are also based on logs but provide a different perspective of the system. Tracing helps you track a request from the point where it enters the system to the point where it leaves the system.

##### 1.2.5 Immutability of containers challenges how you maintain service credentials and access-control policies
(+) A server that doesn’t change its state after it spins up is called an `immutable server`. Each microservice runs in its own container, and as a best practice, the container has to be an immutable server.

(+) With the immutability of containers in mind, this can affect security, as many files and configuration can not be stored on the server's file system (for fear of its being destroyed).

(+) We will need a way to get all the updated policies from some sort of policy administration endpoint at server bootup and then update them dynamically in memory, following a `push or pull model`.

##### 1.2.6 The distributed nature of microservices makes sharing user context harder
(+) In a `monolithic application`, all internal components share the same web session, and anything related to the requesting party (or user) is retrieved from it. In `microservices` architecture, you don’t enjoy that luxury. Nothing is shared among microservices (or only a very limited set of resources), and the user context has to be passed explicitly from one microservice to another.

##### 1.2.7 Polyglot architecture demands more security expertise on each development team
(+) Various components in a system can pick the technology stack that is best for them, is known as a `polygot architecture`.

(+) Because different teams use different technology stacks for development, each team has to have its own security experts. These experts should take responsibility for defining security best practices and guidelines, research security tools for each stack for static code analysis and dynamic testing, and integrate those tools into the build process.

#### 1.3 Key security fundamentals
##### 1.3.1 Authentication protects your system against spoofing
(+) `Authentication` is the process of identifying the requesting party to protect your system against spoofing. The requesting party can be a system (a microservice) or a system requesting access on behalf of a human user or another system.

![[Pasted image 20241116180140.png]]

(+) If you’re worried about a system accessing a microservice on behalf of a human user, you need to think about how to authenticate the system as well as the human user.

(+) To `authenticate the human user to a system` (for example, a web application), you could request the username and password with another factor for multifactor authentication (MFA)

(+) You have multiple ways to `authenticate a system`. The most popular options are cer tificates and JWTs.

##### 1.3.2 Integrity protects your system from data tampering
(+) When you transfer data from your client application to a microservice or from one microservice to another microservice, an intruder could intercept the communication and change the data for their advantage. 
==> If the channel carries data corresponding to an order, for example, the intruder could change its shipping address to their own.

(+) The most common way to protect a message for integrity is to `sign it.` Any data in transit over a communication channel protected with `Transport Layer Security (TLS)`. If you use HTTPS for communications among microservices (that communication is, in fact, HTTP over TLS), your messages are protected for integrity while `in transit`.

(+) Along with the data in transit, the data `at rest` must be protected for integrity. Of all your business data, `audit trails` matter most for integrity checks. An intruder who gets access to your system would be happiest if they could modify your audit trails to wipe out any evidence.

==> In a microservices deployment based on containers, `audit logs aren’t kept at each node that runs the microservice`; they’re published in some kind of a distributed tracing system like Jaeger or Zipkin. You need to make sure that the data maintained in those systems is protected for integrity.

##### 1.3.3 Nonrepudiation: Do it once, and you own it forever
(+) `Nonrepudiation` is an important aspect of information security that prevents you from denying anything you’ve done or committed. Validating the signature alone doesn’t help you achieve nonrepudiation, however. You also need to make sure that you record transactions along with the timestamp and the signature—and maintain those records for a considerable amount of time

##### 1.3.4 Confidentiality protects your systems from unintended information disclosure

![[Pasted image 20241116181411.png]]

###### A. Data in transit
(+) Encryption helps you achieve confidentiality. A cryptographic operation makes sure that the encrypted data is visible only to the intended recipient.

(+) One thing to note, `protection provided by TLS is PTP` (Point to Point) . At the point where the TLS connection terminates, the security ends. If your client application connects to a microservice over a proxy server, `your first TLS connection terminates at the proxy server, and a new TLS connection is established between the proxy server and the microservice`.
==> The risk is that anyone who has access to the proxy server can log the messages in plaintext as soon as the data leaves the first connection.
==> This risk exists as the data from each point (if not being encrypted at the application level) will have to be decrypted (for the proxy to review) and then re-encrypted again to be send to the other point.

###### B. Data at rest
(+) Encryption should also apply to data at rest to protect it from intruders who get direct access to the system. This data can be credentials for other systems stored in the file system or business-critical data stored in a database. Most database management systems provide features for automatic encryption, and `disk-level encryption features are available at the operating-system level`. `Application-level encryption` is another option, in which the application itself `encrypts the data before passing it over to the filesystem or to a database`.

##### 1.3.5 Availability: Keep the system running, no matter what
(+) In a microservices deployment, with many entry points (which may be exposed to the internet), an attacker can execute a denial-of-service (DoS) or a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack and take the system down. 
==> Defenses against such attacks can be built on different levels. On the application level, the best thing you could do is reject a message (or a request) as soon as you find that it’s not legitimate. Having layered security architecture helps you design each layer to take care of different types of attacks and reject an attacker at the outermost layer.

![[Pasted image 20241116193616.png]]

##### 1.3.6 Authorization: Nothing more than you’re supposed to do
(+) `Authentication` helps you learn about the user or the requesting party. `Authorization` determines the actions that an authenticated user can perform on the system.

(+) In a typical microservices deployment, authorization can happen at the edge (the entry point to the microservices deployment, which could be intercepted by a gate way

#### 1.4 Edge Security
(+) In a typical microservices deployment, microservices are not exposed directly to client applications. In most cases, microservices are behind a set of APIs that is exposed to the outside world via an `API gateway`. The API gateway is the entry point to the microservices deployment, which screens all incoming messages for security.

![[Pasted image 20241116195220.png]]

###### 1.4.1 The role of API Gateway in a microservices deployment
(+) APIs and microservices go hand in hand. Most of the time, a microservice that needs to be accessed by a client application is exposed as an API via an API gateway. The key role of the API gateway in a microservices deployment is to expose a selected set of microservices to the outside world as APIs and build quality-of-service (QoS) features. These QoS features are security, throttling, and analytics.

###### 1.4.2 Authentication at the edge
(+) Similar to microservices, even for APIs the audience is a system that acts on behalf of itself or on behalf of a human user or another system. In most cases, an API gateway deals with systems.

![[Pasted image 20241116195518.png]]

###### Certificate-based Authentication
(+) Certificate-based authentication protects an API at the edge with `mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)`. In the Netflix microservices deployment, access to the APIs is pro tected with certificates. Only a client provisioned with a valid certificate can access Netflix APIs.

==> The role of the API gateway here is to make sure that only clients carry ing a trusted certificate can access the APIs and that only those requests are routed to the upstream microservices.

###### Oauth 2.0-based access delegation
(+) OAuth 2.0, which is an authorization framework for delegated access control, is the recommended approach for protecting APIs when one system wants to access an API on behalf of another system or a user.

###### 1.4.3 Authorization at the edge
(+) In addition to figuring out who the requesting party is during the authentication pro cess, the API gateway could enforce corporatewide access-control policies, which are probably coarse-grained. More fine-grained access-control policies are enforced at the service level by the microservice itself

###### 1.4.4 Passing client/end-user context to upstream microservices
(+) The API gateway terminates all the client connections at the edge, and if everything looks good, it dispatches the requests to the corresponding upstream microservices.
(+) `User context` carries basic information about the end user, and `client context` carries information about the client application. This information probably could be used by upstream microservices for service-level access control.
(+) Pass the `user context in an HTTP header, or create a JWT with the user data`. The first option is straightforward but raises some trust concerns when the first microservice passes the same user context in an HTTP header to another microservice. The second microservice doesn’t have any guarantee that the user context isn’t altered. `But with JWT, you have an assurance that a man in the middle can’t change its content and go undetected`, because the issuer of the JWT signs it.

#### 1.5 Securing service-to-service communication
##### 1.5.1 Service-to-service authentication
(+) There are three common ways to secure communications among services in a microservices deployment:` trust the network, mTLS, and JWTs`

###### Trust the network
(+) The trust-the-network approach is an `old-school model in which no security is enforced in service-to-service communication`; rather, the model relies on network-level security. 
(+) Network-level security must guarantee that no attacker can intercept communications among microservices. Also,` each microservice is a trusted system`. Whatever it claims about itself and the end user is trusted by other microservices.

![[Pasted image 20241117013440.png]]


###### Mutual TLS
(+)` Mutual TLS is another popular way to secure service-to-service communications `in a microservices deployment. In fact, this method is the most common form of authentication used today. `Each microservice in the deployment has to carry a public/private key pair and uses that key pair to authenticate to the recipient microservices via mTLS`.

(+) TLS provides confidentiality and integrity for the data in transit, and helps the cli ent identify the service. The client microservice knows which microservice it’s going to talk with. But with TLS (one-way), the recipient microservice can’t verify the identity of the client microservice. That’s where mTLS comes in. mTLS lets each microservice in communication identify the others.

![[Pasted image 20241117013723.png]]

###### JSON Web Tokens
(+) Unlike mTLS, `JWT works at the application layer, not at the transport layer`. JWT is a container that can carry a set of claims from one place to another. These claims can be anything, such as end-user attributes (email address, phone number), end-user entitlements (what the user can do), or anything the calling microservice wants to pass to the recipient microservice. The JWT includes these claims and is signed by the issuer of the JWT. The issuer can be an external STS or the calling microservice itself.

(+) The latter example is a self-issued JWT. As in mTLS, if we use self-issued JWT-based authentication, each microservice must have its own key pair, and the corresponding private key is used to sign the JWT. In most cases, JWT-based authentication works over TLS; JWT provides authentication, and TLS provides confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.

![[Pasted image 20241117013924.png]]

##### 1.5.2 Service-level authorization
(+) In a typical microservices deployment, authorization can happen at the edge (with the API gateway), at the service, or in both places.
(+) Authorization at the service level gives each service more control to enforce access-control policies in the way it wants. Two approaches are used to enforce authorization at the service level: the centralized policy decision point (PDP) model and the embedded PDP model.
(+) In the centralized PDP model, all the access-control policies are defined, stored, and evaluated centrally (see figure 1.12). Each time the service wants to validate a request, it has to talk to an endpoint exposed by the centralized PDP
==> This method creates a lot of dependency on the PDP and also increases the latency because of the cost of calling the remote PDP endpoint. In some cases, the effect on latency can be prevented by caching policy decisions at the service level, but other than cache expiration time, there’s no way to communicate policy update events to the service.

![[Pasted image 20250315162324.png]]

(+) With embedded PDPs, policies are defined centrally but are stored and evaluated at the service level. The challenge with embedded PDPs is how to get policy updates from the centralized policy administration point (PAP)

![[Pasted image 20250315162337.png]]

##### 1.5.3 Propagating user context among microservice
(+) When one microservice invokes another microservice, it needs to carry both the end user identity and the identity of the microservice itself.

(+) When one microservice authenticates to another microservice with mTLS or JWT, the identity of the calling microservice can be inferred from the embedded credentials. There are 3 common ways to pass end-user context:

1. Send the user context as an HTTP header. This technique helps the recipient microservice identify the user but requires the recipient to trust the calling microservice. If the calling microservice wants to fool the recipient microservice, it can do so easily by setting any name it wants as the HTTP header.
2. Use a JWT. This JWT carries the user context from the calling microservice to the recipient microservice and is also passed in the HTTP request as a header. This approach has no extra value in terms of security over the first approach if the JWT that carries the user context is self-issued. A self-issued JWT is signed by the calling service itself, so it can fool the recipient microservice by adding any name it wants to add.
3. Use a JWT issued by an external STS that is trusted by all the microservices in the deploy ment. The user context included in this JWT can’t be altered, as alteration would invalidate the signature of the JWT. This is the most secure approach. When you have the JWT from an external STS, the calling microservice can embed that JWT in the new JWT it creates to make a nested JWT (if JWT-based authentication is used among microservices) or pass the original JWT as-is, as an HTTP header (if mTLS is being used among microservices)

##### 1.5.4 Crossing trust boundaries
(+) In a typical microservices deployment, you find multiple trust domains. We can define these trust domains by the` teams having control and governance over the microservices or organizational boundaries`. The purchasing department, for example, might manage all its microservices and create its own trust domain.

(+) In terms of security, when one microservice talks to another microservice, and `both microservices are in the same trust domain, each microservice may trust one STS in the same domain or a certificate authority in the same domain`. Based on this trust, the recipient microservice can validate a security token sent to it by a calling microservice. `Typically, in a single trust domain, all the microservices trust one STS and accept only security tokens issued by that STS.`

(+) When one microservice wants to talk to another microservice in a different trust domain, it can take one of two primary approaches.

###### In the first approach
(+) In this approach, the calling microservice must first obtain a security token that is trusted by all microservices in the recipient's trust domain (meaning the STS from the recipient's trust domain)

![[Pasted image 20250315164255.png]]

`Step 1`: The API Gateway route the request to Order Processing, with the JWT signed by the gateway or the STS attached to the gateway itself, as all services in the `foo` domain trust the STS, the Order Processing Service will accept the token as valid.

`Step 2`: The Order Processing determines that this request will need to go to the Delivery Service, which is in a different trust domain. If it wants to do so, it must have the JWT signed by the STS from `bar` domain. 
To compete this, it will send the JWT it got from the API Gateway (or the STS attached to it) to the STS in `foo` domain. STS in `foo` domain will determine if the audience of the JWT is valid, if not reject it.

`Step 3`: The STS in `foo` domain return a new JWT, signed by it, with the `aud` field of the `bar` domain

`Step 4 and 5`: The Order Processing service access the STS of the `bar` trust domain and exchanges the JWT from step 3 for a new JWT signed by the STS of `bar` domain with the `aud` field of Delivery Service.

`Step 6`: The Order Processing service access the Delivery microservice with the JWT obtained from Step 5, as the JWT is signed by the STS in `bar` domain with the `aud` of the Delivery Service, it will be accepted as valid.

###### In the second approach
(+) In this approach the Order Processing Service does not talk directly to the Delivery Service, instead each domain has its own API Gateway, and communication happens via the gateway

![[Pasted image 20250315170108.png]]

`Step 1`: The API Gateway route the client application's request to the Order Processing Service. With the JWT signed by `foo` STS and `aud` of `Order Processing Service`.

`Step 2`: The Order Processing Service passes the JWT to `foo` STS.

`Step 3`: `foo` STS returns a new JWT which is signed by it and the `aud` is the `bar` domain's API Gateway.

`Step 4`: Order Processing Service access the `bar` domain via the API Gateway, as the STS in `foo` trust the API Gateway, the JWT signed by `foo` has `aud` of the API Gateway, so it accepts this request as valid.

`Step 5`: `bar` APIG talks to the STS in `bar` to create a new JWT signed by `bar` STS with an `aud` of Delivery Service.

`Step 6`: The `bar` API gateway forwards the request to Delivery Service, DS will accept this as the JWT is signed by `bar` STS and `aud` is DS.
